    <string name="paragraph_about0">
        This app is being developed and maintained by a small group of amateur and professional
        developers. We came together through a post on
        <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dota2/">/r/dota2</a>. You can follow the development and see
        the whole source code
        <a href="https://github.com/Rhacco/DotaScoop/">here</a>.
    </string>
    <string name="paragraph_about1">
        We started this app in the hopes of learning more about Android development. It has been
        quite a journey already and we are always looking to learn more by implementing new things.

        The current state of the app is not the final result of this project. We are always looking
        for feedback, especially related to the UI. If you have any suggestions or bug reports,
