        Overviews of top tournament and ranked matches currently being played and recently finished.
        Live matches are delayed just like in the Dota 2 spectator client.\n\n
        Tournament matches show the pro teams\' names instead of \"Radiant\" and \"Dire\". Live
        ranked matches are sorted by average MMR and pro players are highlighted with a distinct
        color. Recent matches are sorted by time finished (most recent at the top of the list).\n\n
        Swipe left and right to switch between live and recent matches. Click once on a match to
        show or hide additional information. Quickly click twice on a ranked match to switch between
        pro players\' official names and current Steam names.\n\n
        Type the command below a live match into your Dota 2 console and press Enter to start
        spectating the chosen match in your Dota 2 client.
