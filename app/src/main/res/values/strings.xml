        This app is being developed and maintained by a small group of amateur and professional
        developers. We came together through a post on
        <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dota2/">/r/dota2</a>. You can follow the development and see
        the whole source code
        <a href="https://github.com/Rhacco/Dota2AndroidApp/">here</a>.

    <string name="paragraph_about1">
        We started this app in the hopes of learning more about Android development. It has been
        quite a journey already and we are always looking to learn more by implementing new things.
